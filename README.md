## Lesson four
A demo weblog created with Express.js & MongoDB.
### Reasons to use Express.js
**Why did I use the Express.js ?**<br>
Express has the biggest community not only out of the three frameworks compared here but out of all the web application frameworks for Node.js. It is the most matured framework out of the three, with almost 5 years of development behind it and now has StrongLoop taking control of the repository. It offers a simple way to get a server up and running and promotes code reuse with it's built in router.
<br>**Why did not I use the Koa.js ?**<br>
Koa is still unstable and heavily in development. Using ES6 is still ahead of the game for example version 0.11.9+ of Node.js needs to be used to run Koa and right now the latest stable version on Node.js is version 0.10.33. One thing that is in the good but could also be in the bad much like Express is the option of selecting multiple middlewares or writing your own middleware. Such as the router we looked at earlier, there are a lot of middleware routers to handle a variety of options.
<br>**Why did not I use the Hapi.js ?**<br>
Hapi definitely seems to be more tailored towards bigger or more complex applications. It is probably a little too much boilerplate code to throw together a simple web app and there is also a lot less examples or open source applications that use hapi. So choosing it might involve a little more part on the developer rather than using third party middleware.
